Chasing plr:
	Start chase timer
	While in sight:
		Increase chase timer
	While lost sight:
		Set state to Searching
		Create search area (closest unobstructed node to player + its neighbors)
		Patrol the search area:
			Set patrol route to search area
			Set routeIndex to 0 (the node closest to plr is added first, so 0 is always the closest to plr last seen)
			If at node:
				Do lookAround
			If at last node (nodeIndex >= searchRoute.Count)
				Set state to patrolling
			If state times out (time based on chase time):
				Set state to Looking
				Look around

Patrolling:
	If sees plr:
		Start suspicion timer
	While sees plr:
		Increase suspicion timer (goes up faster when plr is well-lit or closer to enemy)
		If suspicion timer >= suspicion threshold:
			Set state to Chasing
	If doesn't see plr:
		If suspicion timer >= search threshold:
			Look around
